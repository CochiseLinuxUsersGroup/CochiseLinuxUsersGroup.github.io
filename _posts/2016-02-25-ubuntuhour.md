**Linux news**:
Mint 17.3 Cinnamon (both 32 and 64 bit) hacked on 20 Feb 16. If you downloaded the ISO on that date and didn't use a torrent, it is bogus. Check the MD5Sum and you will see that the hashes do not match. The mirror was taken down. <http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2994>.

The Mint forum is back up and they recommend that you change your password.
  
**Discussion**:
There were two lectures yesterday (24 February) co-sponsored by UA South and IEEE, Congress and CyberSecurity (1130-1230) and Elections and Technology (1700-1800). The CyberSecurity lecture was spot on considering the Apple vs. FBI conflict that is going on now. The Elections and Technology discussed Gerrymandering of districts to make 400-405 of the representative districts to be considered safe for one party or another so that there is no loyalty to the electorate but rather to the party.
There was also some discussion on the installation of Ubuntu to a flash drive.
The release party for Ubuntu 16.04 is scheduled for 14 May starting at 1500 in Chandler. As more details become available they will be released.
