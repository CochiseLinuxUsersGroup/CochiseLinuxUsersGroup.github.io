 * An install was scheduled for Charles Breaux but was not done because of a great amount of data (200GB plus) that was on the computer that was not backed up.  He was given a USB thumb drive with Ubuntu on it and explicit instructions on how to install it after he has backed up his data.

**Aftermath:**

 * We retired to Vinney's where we enjoyed some pizza and some additional Linux and FOSS topics of conversation as well as some topics that were not related.
 * We were asked what CLUG stood for by an individual who thought it was a drinking association.  He was put on the right track.
