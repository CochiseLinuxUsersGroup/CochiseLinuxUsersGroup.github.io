 * West End Fair – 05 May 2018 Although no consensus was reached or probably ever will.  We will continue to participate.
 
**Discussion:**

 * A question was raised concerning the inability of an HP laptop to boot from a flash drive. Without having the laptop present, it was difficult to troubleshoot the problem. However it was suggested that perhaps the flash drive was being recognized as an additional hard drive like some Dell laptops do.  It was also recommended that he bring the laptop to a meeting if he continues to have trouble with it.
 
**Aftermath:**

 * We adjourned to the Pizza Hut where we continued to talk about Linux and non-Linux related subjects as well as enjoyed some pizza.
