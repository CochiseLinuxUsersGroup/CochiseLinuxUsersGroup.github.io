 * If you have a computer that has the dreaded supervisor/BIOS/power-on password and that password has been lost or forgotten. There is a way to backdoor it in most models.  When you attempt to log on you will get a message that you need to enter the password.  After three unsuccessful attempts you will generally be given an error code.  Copy it down and go to https://bios-pw.org and follow the instructions  Enter the failure code and you will be given the backdoor password.  Obviously, you need another computer to do that.
