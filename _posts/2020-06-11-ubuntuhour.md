**Discussion:**

 * There has recently been some additional confusion reference the date and time of CLUG events.  While generally a mass email is sent to the mailing list, all events are on our Group calendar which of course is on our website.  If you are a Facebook person, you can join the CLUG Facebook page.  All of our events are listed there.  They are also listed on the Sierra Vista Herald Review’s calendar.  Normally they are also publicized in the Cochise Trading Post.  There have also been largely unsuccessful attempts at listing them on the city of Sierra Vista’s calendar and the Desert Shopper as well as the community calendar on one of our local radio stations.  Our monthly recurring events are:
Ubuntu Hour - 2nd Thursday of each month at Schlotzsky’s.  1800-1900
Monthly meeting - 4th Saturday at the Sierra Vista library (when it re-opens), 1300-1545. Until then we will be conducting them on line using Big Blue Button unless a physical meeting is required.
 * Discussed possible physical locations for meetings
 * Discussed future presentations:
  1. How to do an installation defining the partitions yourself. (27 June – Rex).
  2. A Hands on Installation. (25 July – Team) 3 computers will be available to have a Linux OS installed.  Members will act as clients.  Members will do the install.  We should be able to do 9 installs baring problems.
