The Cochise Linux User Group, CLUG, in conjunction with the Ubuntu Arizona Local Community Team, AZLOCO, conducted a Linux Workshop-Installation Festival on Saturday, 21 May 2022 at the Warrior Healing Center, 1838 Paseo San Luis, Sierra Vista AZ.  Nine people attended the event.  The purpose of this Linux Workshop/Installfest was to install Ubuntu 22.04 or Linux Mint 20.3 on any computers that were presented by guests.

**PREPARATIONS:**

 * The installfest was announced in the Sierra Vista Herald/Review, the Cochise Trader. Brochures were placed in 20 locations around the town.  Members on the mailing list were provided with a copy of the brochure with instructions to post them at their work place and/or favorite place to visit.
 * The wired and wireless internet at the Warrior Healing Center was once again more than adequate for the conduct of our installfests.
 * The group has additional switches, a spare monitor, spare VGA, DVI, and HDMI cables, spare power cables, two spare keyboards (one of which has a P2 connector), and a spare mouse should any be required because an individual failed to bring the necessary equipment.  This box of equipment is always present at our installfests.
 * Tools and spare CMOS batteries were present.
 * The installfest was announced in the Sierra Vista Herald/Review, the Cochise Trader. Brochures were placed in 20 locations around the town.  Members on the mailing list were provided with a copy of the brochure with instructions to post them at their work place and/or favorite place to visit.
 * Spare RAM for laptops and desktops was available should any computer require additional memory.

**ACTIVITIES:**

 * The set up took less than 15 minutes with 3 people involved.
 * There were 3 donated computers present for installation.  One had only 128 Mbs of SDRAM, could not be upgraded, and was deemed unusable.  One had broken hinges that could not be repaired.  The third would not boot even after changing RAM, monitors, cables, video cards, etc.  So there were no installs.
 * A one on one training session was held for an individual on how to install additional programs.
 * A one on one training session was held for an individual on the basics of operating a computer in a Linux environment.
 * A one on one training session was held for an individual on how to install using a thumb drive which had already been prepared, to include how to get into the BIOS and how to change the boot order.
