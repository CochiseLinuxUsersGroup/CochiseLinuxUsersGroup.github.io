We were asked by Dr John DeLalla, the Director of Continuing Education at the University of Arizona South, to provide the hardware, installation media, and installers for some students attending a Security Summer Camp at the UA South who desired to have a Linux distribution installed on their computer.  We complied on 28 July 2017.  However, there was only one student who brought her computer for us to install Ubuntu on it.  There were six CLUG members present at one time or another during the event.  The installation was performed in short order without a problem and the client was extremely happy with the outcome.
