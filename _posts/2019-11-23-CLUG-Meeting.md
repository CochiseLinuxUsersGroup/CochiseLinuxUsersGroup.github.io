### Meeting Minutes:

**Attendees:** 13

**Upcoming CLUG Events:**

**Presentation:**

 * Cloning and Clonezilla by Gene Zastera

**Discussion/Problems/Questions:**

 * We will no longer be able to reserve the library conference room a year in advance.  We must do so no more than 90 days in advance.  That should not be a problem plus we always have one of the conference rooms at the Warrior Healing Center as a back up.
 * The Ubuntu-Arizona Local Community Team is about to lose its status as a verified LoCo since there are no Local Community Council members to approve the Team.  Interesting development.
 * Rex attended the IEEE ExCom meeting and the only things of interest to us are the future free lectures; Reliability Society on 5 December, Self Driving Car Security on 27 January, and Drone Mapping some time in February.  More information will be distributed as it becomes available.
 * 4 members of CLUG attended the UA South free lecture on the Reâ€™s of Software Development.
 * We made an attempt to do an install on an ACER cloud Book but were unsuccessful.

**Aftermath:**
 
 * We retired to Peter Piper Pizza to continue our conversation and enjoy some pizza.
