We went to the park to have a dry run of the setup of our canopy and table for the West End Fair May 7th. Four people showed up and the setup went well and with a few kinks and laughs everything went up and ideas about placement and further setup for banners and such was discussed.

After setup we all went to Culiver's for a late lunch/early dinner.

Here's some Pictures by Rose:
