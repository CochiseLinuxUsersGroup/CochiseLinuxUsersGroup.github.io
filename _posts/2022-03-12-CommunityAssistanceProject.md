The Cochise Linux User Group, CLUG, in conjunction with the Ubuntu Arizona Local Community Team, AZLOCO, conducted a community assistance project on Saturday, 12 March 2022 at the Warrior Healing Center, 1838 Paseo San Luis, Sierra Vista AZ.  Four people attended the event.  The purpose of this event was to set up their Operations Center.  Wired Internet connectivity was established in the room and three computers with Ubuntu 20.04.4 were set up for their use.  One additional computer will be added at a later date.  The computers used either belonged to the Warrior Healing Center or were donated by the Cochise Linux User Group.
