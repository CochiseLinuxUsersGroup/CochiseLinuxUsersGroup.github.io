 * There was an excellent article on the CLUG published in the Sierra Vista Herald/Review last Tuesday.  We should get some great publicity out of it.

* We are still working on Group T-shirts.  If we can get enough people who will commit to getting one, the cost should be around $15 per.
 * Roger and Louise Lance indicated that there are a number of people who live in Sunsites that could benefit from a Ubuntu installation.  They will be in contact with the details and we may schedule a road trip to do an installfest there or as a minimum a presentation on Linux.
