 * Jaidan Braswell’s ASCII Games is currently on track for 23 September.
 * There was a request for a Thunderbird presentation that would basically show how to configure multiple email accounts in the application.

**Discussion:**

 * Centered around Chris Braswell’s computer.  He had installed Ubuntu 16.04.3 using Legacy instead of UEFI and he was having some issues.  After a somewhat lengthy demonstration of the problems, it was suggested that he do a re-install using UEFI.  Since he had to back up some of his data, the re-install could not take place at the meeting.
