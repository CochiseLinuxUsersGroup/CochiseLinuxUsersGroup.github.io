**August Installfest update - Rex:**

 * Installfest brochures are printed and ready for posting next week.  They will also be mailed to the CLUG mailing list next week.
 * 18.04 media has been created (on DVDs and USB thumb drives) and tested by Rex.

**Discussion/Problems/Questions:**

 * An individual has a laptop and four laptop hard drives each with a different OS installed on it.  He wants to quad boot with all of the OSs on one large hard drive.  The four Oss  are Win10, Win10, Win7, and Ubuntu.  The easiest solution would be to install Ubuntu on the hard drive and install the three Windows OS in VM however the laptop does not have sufficient RAM and you cannot mix EFI and BIOS installs on the same hard disk.
 * A second question was also raised about how to watch Netflix on a Linux based OS.  A quick Internet search reveals many URLs with How to do it.

**Aftermath**

 * We adjourned the meeting and reconvened at Native Grill and Wings for some nourishment and additional conversation on FOSS subjects and some subjects completely unrelated to anything close to being technology related.
