**Announcements:**
 * Listed the computer spare parts and accessories that the group has available for members.

**Discussion:**
 * Discussed Web Progressive Applications.
 * A member had a problem with Samba.  Since he only wanted to transfer a small number of documents from one computer to a second computer, he was advised to transfer them via a USB flash drive rather than trying to try to configure Samba.
 * An attendee had a problem printing with his Chrome Book and HP printer.  The printer had to be added each time he wanted to print a document.  Since he had brought neither to the meeting he was advised to bring them to the next meeting so a possible solution could be offered.
