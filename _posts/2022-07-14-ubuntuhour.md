**Discussion:**
 * Discussed having a meeting during the week rather than a Saturday.  It was decided to try a short meeting in August as a test in an attempt to get more people attending the events.  The date and time will be released after a location can be reserved.
 * Discussed having a link to the Cochise Linux Google Group on the Cochise Linux User Group website.  It was completed before the meeting ended.  All someone has to do if they have joined the Cochise Linux Google Group is log into their Google account and select their Google Drive.  The Cochise Linux Google Drive documents have been shared with them.  Select "Shared with me" and you will be able to see the documents.
 * Discussed having a quick workshop to install Linux operating systems on 8 computers.  The date selected was this Saturday, 16 July 2022, at 1000 until 1400 hours at the Warrior Healing Center.
 * Discussed the possibility of using Word Press to create a blog for the Group.  Bruce is exploring this option
