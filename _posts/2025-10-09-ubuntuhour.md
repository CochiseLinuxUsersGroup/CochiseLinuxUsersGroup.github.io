**Discussion and Activities:**
 * Discussed Ventoy and its capability to store files in addition to the ISOâ€™s
 * A member had a problem with trying to get his documents off a dual boot computer (Ubuntu and Linux Mint) that he had not backed up.  Recommended that he first boot into one of the distros and copy the files to a flash drive and then boot to the second distro and copy the files to the same flash drive.  The documents can then be transferred to a newer computer.
