The Cochise Linux User Group, CLUG, in conjunction with the Ubuntu Arizona Local Community Team, AZLOCO, conducted an Installation Festival on Saturday, 15 July 2022 at the Warrior Healing Center, 1838 Paseo San Luis, Sierra Vista AZ.  Seven people attended the event, 5 physically and 2 virtually via Big Blue Button.  The purpose of this Installfest was to install Ubuntu 22.04 or another Linux distributio on 8 computers that have been donated.


**PREPARATIONS:**

 * The wired and wireless internet at the Warrior Healing Center was once again more than adequate for the conduct of our installfests.
 * The group had additional switches, a spare monitor, spare VGA, DVI, and HDMI cables, spare power cables, two spare keyboards (one of which has a PS2 connector), and a spare mouse should any be required.  This box of equipment is always present at our installfests.
 * Tools and spare CMOS batteries were present.
 * Spare RAM and hard drives were available should any computer require them.

**ACTIVITIES:**

 * The set up took less than 20 minutes with 3 people involved.
 * There were 8 donated computers present for installation.
 * Six installs were completed. (3 Ubuntu 22.04 and 3 MX Linux 21.1)
 * Two of the computers were deemed unusable.
 * One of our installers was guided through an installation of MX Linux so it was a learning experience for him as it was his first install of that distribution.
