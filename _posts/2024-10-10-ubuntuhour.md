**Announcements:**

 * We have 32 people on our mailing list and 46 members on our Facebook page.
 * We have 1 desktop computer and 1 laptop computer ready for donation.

**Discussion and Activities:**
 * Discussed Ventoy and its usefulness in installing.  There will be a presentation and a hands on workshop on Ventoy at the next meeting on 22 October.
 * One of the new attendees brought in a computer that froze up after an attempt to upgrade.  We worked on it but were unsuccessful in repairing it.  Best guess was the hard drive was ready to die and since the screen was constantly flickering the video card was also in the process of dying.  Could not even get Ubuntu to boot correctly in live mode.  He was offered one of the computers that we have ready for donation but declined the offer.
 * Distributed information on the group to the new attendees.
