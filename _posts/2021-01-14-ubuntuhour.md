**Announcements:**
 * New date for the Ubuntu 20.04.2 release is 11 February.
 * Linux Mint 20.1 was released 08 January.  The ISOs have been downloaded and our install media has been updated.

**Discussion:**
 * A member asked why “apropos” would not work on the terminal of his laptop while it worked on both of his desktops.  After further investigation, it was discovered that it did work.  Lesson learned:  Make sure you spell your command correctly  when using the terminal.
 * A member asked if there was a different kind of a mouse he could use with limited feeling in his hand.  A mouse with a track ball was suggested.  Unfortunately, we currently have none in our Put and Take box but they are relatively inexpensive.
 * Mike gave us an update on his LLC project for kids.  He will soon be ready for the us to install a Linux OS on his 10 computers.  In addition we have 2 more computers that already have a Linux OS installed on them to donate to his project.
 * Discussed the mailing list and how to get on it. Assisted 3 people in doing that.
 * A member asked for a keyboard, mouse, and an ac adapter for a Dell laptop from the Put and Take box.  Action Rex.
