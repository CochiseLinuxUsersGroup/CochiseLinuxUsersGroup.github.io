**Presentation:**   
 * “What’s new in 22.04” by Rex Bouwense

**Discussion/Problems/Questions:**
 * The use of Zoom or Big Blue Button was discussed.  Those present seemed to prefer Zoom if we ever had to conduct an on line meeting.
 * Discussed the desirability of having an interactive page on our web site where any member could post a question, or an article on a particular application that he or she has found very useful or shared notes that were discovered when using a particular application or operating system.
 * An additional page where individuals could post topics that they would like to see covered in a presentation was also discussed and desired by those present.
 * An attempted install of Linux Mint 20.3 was made in a dual boot mode with a previously installed Microsoft Windows 7.  It failed to install the EUFI boot loader.  After deleting the partitions, and showing the owner exactly what she must do to install, she was sent on her way with contacts should she run into problems.
