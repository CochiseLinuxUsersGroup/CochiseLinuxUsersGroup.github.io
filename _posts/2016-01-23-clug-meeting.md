There were no presentations given at the meeting but there was discussion about car pooling to the AZLOCO/PLUG installation Festival in Tempe. There is plenty of interest. A second topic discussed was the new browser, Brave, being released by former Mozilla CEO that comes with its own ad blocker. However, it apparently allows its own ads (to make money) to be displayed. <http://www.extremetech.com/internet/221685-former-mozilla-ceo-unveils-brave-browser-that-blocks-ads-by-default-but-substitutes-its-own> and <http://www.cnet.com/news/> is-the ad-blocking-brave-browser-too-good-to-be-true
  
Rex Bouwense reported on his activities at the AZLOCO/PLUG installfest that he attended on 16 January. The Group now has access to a projector and a server compliments of AZLOCO, Todd Cole, and Rex Bouwense. Two suggestions for presentations were made by Louie Garcia. A detective from the police department has extensive knowledge of forensic security and there is a Homeland Security representative (from Bisbee) that can give a presentation on communication. He will work on making that happen.
  
The meeting was adjourned and the group reconvened at the IHOP for some food and additional Linux/FOSS talk as well as topics that strayed beyond that area.
