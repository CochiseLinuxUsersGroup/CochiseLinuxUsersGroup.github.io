 * Our new attendee asked if a Linux Operating System could be installed on a computer from 2004 with Microsoft Windows installed.  Since he did not have the technical specifications he was advised to bring it to a Ubuntu Hour or another Meeting where we could have a look
 * Because most of the attendees had other commitments, the dining portion of the meeting was cancelled much to the chagrin of Rex and Greg who enjoyed a cigarette outside of the library before adjourning.
