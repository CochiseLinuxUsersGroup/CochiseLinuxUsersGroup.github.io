**Announcements:**
 * As of today we have donated 78 computers to individuals and/or groups and conducted 152 Linux installs.
 * Canonical has inserted an Apt-News “infomercial” when you run apt update or apt upgrade on your computer.  If it doesn’t bother you, do nothing. If you want to get rid of it, open a terminal and type:  sudo pro config set apt_news=false
 * Some bad news about the polo shirts from Wicked Limits.  While they can be had in 40 different colors, the cost is $29.98 plus tax for short sheeve and $36.98 plus tax for long sleeve. The sizes run from small to X large.  Sizes over XL cost an additional $2.50 per X.  Research continues.

**Discussion/Problems/Questions:**
 * A member asked where can he find the applications to install that are listed on the 7 page handout.  They can be downloaded from the Ubuntu Software Center, the icon is the orange suitcase with a big A on it.
 * A member updated his file transfer problem with Ubuntu.  His computer would suspend during the transfer after a certain time.  Apparently file transfer is not counted as activity on his computer.  He was advised to set his power management settings to “never” during the file transfer.
