The Cochise Linux User Group donated two refurbished laptop computers with Ubuntu 18.04.3 installed on them and two computer monitors to the Warrior Healing Center to be used in their Operations Center.  In addition we provided assistance to configure three of their computers to have multiple monitor capability.
