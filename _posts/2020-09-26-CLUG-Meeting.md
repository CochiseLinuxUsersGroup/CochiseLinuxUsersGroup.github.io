**Discussion/Problems/Questions:**
 * We discussed the pros and cons of upgrading to the next version or doing a fresh install after a question was raised about which was better.  It is really based on personal preference and personal experience.

**Aftermath:**
 * Some of the members retired to Vinneyâ€™s (where we were met by Lilith and Ruby) for some pizza and additional conversation.  Our unofficial leader was also soundly chastised for attempting to move tables and benches so we could all sit as a group.
