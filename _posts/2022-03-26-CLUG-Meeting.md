**Presentation:**   
 * PWAs (Progressive Web Applications) by Terrel DeCampo and Rex Bouwense

 **Discussion/Problems/Questions:**
  * Gene gave an update on his power wall project.
  * Gene asked how to change the icon size on Ubuntu.  (Menu→Settings→Appearance)
  * Gene asked if we could hold a meeting at the Warrior Healing Center where members could bring in their computers to have a problem repaired by the other members. (This can be piggy backed on our Installfests/Linux Workshops which are held 3-4 times a year.  The next one is tentatively scheduled for some time in May)
  * Ron raised his printer problem.  He could not get all three of his computers to print wirelessly.  (He could connect the printer directly to the router with a USB cable or insure that each computer recognized the printer by pinging the printer from each computer.)
  * Distributed information about the Cochise Linux User Group to the new individual.
  * Distributed a USB flash drive install media to a member who needed to install Ubuntu on her machine.
