**Discussion:**
 * Discussed the 3rd point release of Ubuntu 20.04 on 26 August and the release of Linux Mint 20.3 by Christmas.
 * Discussed topics for presentations.  Since 40 plus presentations have been given, a recommendation was made to use our spare computers and hand then out to members so they can install a Linux distribution on then give a short presentation on the distribution to the gathered members to include any problems or hiccups that occurred during installation, how the distribution handled during daily use, any problems that may have occurred during updates, pros and cons of using the distribution plus anything else that may be of interest.  Distributions that were considered include; Elementary, Linux Mint, Pop OS, MX Linux, and AntiX.
