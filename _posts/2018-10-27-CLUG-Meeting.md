**Recent Linux/FOSS News Items:**

 * Ubuntu 18.10 Cosmic Cuttlefish has been released in 64 bit only.  Kubuntu and Xubuntu 18.10 have been released in 32 and 64 bit.  Ubuntu Mate and Ubuntu Budgie 18.10 have been released in 64 bit only.  Lubuntu 18.10 has been released in 32 and 64 bit but in lieu of LXDE it now has the LXQT desktop which  is the developers attempt to “modernize” the distribution.  It comes with a whole new set of default applications and the ISO increased from about 1 GB to 1.69 GB.
 
**Presentation:**

 * Ubuntu by Rex Bouwense
 * It covered Ubuntu and its five officially supported  “flavors” 
 * The history, minimum install requirements, desktop, and default applications were discussed for each distribution.

**Discussion/Problems/Questions:**

 * Chris was not prepared to discuss his Toshiba DVD malfunction but supplied the attending members with some very tasteful chocolate bread to alleviate their disappointment.
 * Jaidon was also not prepared to discuss his Wireless problem and he brought nothing to sooth the members ire.
 * Since we have some new members that do not possess a CLUG T-shirt, Rex is gathering names and sizes to order some additional shirts.  Apparently there was no objection to the color of the shirt or the design so that will be repeated with the new order.  Should you want a T-shirt, contact Rex with your desired size.
 * A concern was raised about booting from a flash drive or DVD.  A demonstration was staged on booting from a flash drive and it was stressed that nothing is changed in the computer.  It is a live system.  Any changes that you make will not be saved upon reboot because everything is done in the RAM until you decide to install.  However, it allows you to see if your hardware is compatible with the distribution and gives the user an idea of what the distro looks like and how the applications function without making any changes to the hard drive.
 * Rex assured those present that preparations for the installfest next Saturday have been completed.  A review of the documents to be used was conducted  and all present were briefed on their required actions.
 * Since the great majority of those present had other commitments there was no restaurant chosen  to continue our discussion.
 * New attendees did learn that penguins can fly and do aerial twists.
