 * Sierra Vista Installation Festival
 
  * The tentative date is 28 January.
  * Location still to be determined, either the Sierra Vista public library conference room or the UA South Resource Learning Center commons area.  Right now the UA South seems to be the leading contender.
  * Install media is on hand in both DVDs and thumb drives i386 and amd64 as well as MultiSystem thumb drives in both i386 and amd64.
  * Have decided to only install Ubuntu or Lubuntu on client machines.
  * Have decided not to be responsible for backing up client's data.
  * We need three laptops present, one with the Ubuntu desktop, one with the Lubuntu desktop, and one to use as a search computer for our team to research problems.
  * Publicize the event in newspaper, radio, fliers, and our website.  See if the Herald will do a short news article on the CLUG and the install-fest.
  * Set up email address so people can reach us.
  * Inform people and have a poster saying that they must have everything to operate their computer, keyboard, power cable, mouse, monitor and that they are responsible for backing up their own data.
  * Start training sessions for members on installation procedures at the next meeting, 24 September.  The concept is three training sessions:  installing using BIOS, installing using UEFI, installing dual boot.
  
* Community projects update: 
 * Presentation for high/middle school computer clubs.  Still looking for a project leader.  We have been asked to do a 10 minute talk about Linux to two Cyber Patriot teams that Dr John Delala is coaching in the October time frame.  Rex Bouwense will handle this.
 * Sierra Vista Christmas parade – Louis Garcia, project manager
