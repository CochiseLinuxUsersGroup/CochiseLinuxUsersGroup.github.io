### Date: Thursday, March 11, 2021

### Meeting Notes:

**Attendees:** 10

**Upcoming Events:**
 * 27 March, CLUG Meeting, 1300-1500, 143 Street Tacos, 80 S. Carmichael Ave., Sierra Vista
 * 08 April, Sierra Vista Ubuntu Hour, 1800-1900, Schlotzsky's Cafe, 3900 Fry Blvd, Sierra Vista
 * 10 April, Linux Workshop, 1000-1300, Warrior Healing Center, 1838 Paseo San Luis, Sierra Vista

**Discussion:**
 * Discussed the new Ubuntu Installer to be previewed with the 21.10 release.  The Repair Installation option on the welcome page is probably the big addition.
 * Discussed the upcoming Linux Workshop to be held at the Warrior Healing Center main conference room on 10 April from 1000-1300
 * A member had a problem sending an email which kept on being bounced back.  Since he could send it if he typed the address, the contact address was probably corrupted.  To correct the problem, he was advised to delete the contact and then add it back to his address book.
