###Meeting Notes:  
The first Saturday meeting of the Cochise Linux User Group was held at the Sierra Vista public library conference room on 7 November 2015 from 1400 - 1545.  There were 11 people present including 6 first time attendees.  There was some discussion on current Linux news, future meeting presentations, and the format for up-coming meetings.  Three of the more popular Linux distributions recently have released new versions: Fedora, Open SUSE, and Ubuntu. Short 5 minute presentations on Application of the Month and "How to Do" things in a Linux Operating System are planned for future meetings.  A presentation on "The Terminal for Beginners" was given by Paul Bernard.  This was the kick off for our Terminal Commands of the Month series which we intend to continue at each meeting.  Two user problems were raised, an UEFI install problem and a "hypothetical" bash scripting problem.  Both problems were eventually presented with solutions after the conclusion of the meeting.
