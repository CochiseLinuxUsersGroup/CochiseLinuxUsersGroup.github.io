**Discussion/Problems/Questions:**
 * A member asked how can he export his bookmarks to his new system.  If using FireFox, you can create an account in FireFox and sync the bookmarks or you can simply export them to a flash drive and then plug the flash drive into the new computer and import them from there.
 * A member asked how could he find files if he only has a partial name.  That can be achieved by the use of wild cards (*), ie;  *clug*
 * A member asked about photography programs that work on a Linux platform.  GIMP, and Raw Therapy were quickly suggested.
 * A member asked if we were still accepting used laptop donations.  The answer was yes.
 * Firewalls were discussed and how to enable them if not enabled by default.
 * Anti-virus software was discussed even there is no particular reason to have an anti-virus application installed on a Linux distro.
