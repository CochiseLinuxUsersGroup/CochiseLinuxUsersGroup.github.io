  A meeting of the Cochise Linux User Group, CLUG, was held on 18 November 2015 at the University of Arizona Sierra Vista campus, classroom C165A North from 1700-1830.  There was a presentation co-sponsored by the University of Arizona Continuing Education Division and the IEEE Fort Huachuca section on Understanding and Implementing Agile Scrum.
