The Cochise Linux User Group, CLUG, in conjunction with the Ubuntu Arizona Local Community Team, AZLOCO, conducted an Installation Festival on Saturday, 18 May 2024 at the Warrior Healing Center, 1838 Paseo San Luis, Sierra Vista AZ.  Eight people attended the event. 

**PREPARATIONS:**

 * The wired and wireless internet at the Warrior Healing Center was once again more than adequate for the conduct of our installfests.
 * The group had additional switches, a spare monitor, spare VGA, DVI, and HDMI cables, spare power cables, two spare keyboards (one of which has a PS2 connector), and a spare mouse should any be required.  This box of equipment is always present at our installfests.
 * Tools and spare CMOS batteries were present.
 * Spare RAM and hard drives were available should any computer require them.  (One computer required a hard drive.)

**ACTIVITIES:**

 * The set up took less than 20 minutes with 3 people involved.
 * Ubuntu 24.04 was installed on the 5 Warrior Healing Center Computer lab computers, on 3 computers that were ready for donation, and on 2 computers that were brought in by individuals.  Linux Mint Debian Edition 6 was installed on 1 computer that an individual brought in for a total of 11 installs.
 * A repair and update of a laptop computer with Ubuntu 22.04 installed was done for an individual who walked in.
 * Conducted one on one training sessions for two separate individuals.
