**Future Presentations:**

 * TBA, “Using Remmina” by Rex Bouwense

**Discussion/Activities:**
 * Discussed the proposed Ubuntu Hour location move from Schlotzski’s to Vinny’s.  There was no objection but the move will probably not take place for several months due to administrative and publicity restrictions.
 * Discussed the Linux Workshop which will take place once a quarter in lieu of a regular meeting.  So each quarter will now have a regular meeting, a Linux workshop, and a supper meeting.
 * Mike gave a brief update on the group’s donations to AZ STEAM.
 * Bruce did present a problem that he was unable to solve, involving a NVIDEA card driver which was causing his computer to freeze up while playing a game.  Unfortunately solutions that were offered had already been tried by him and were unsuccessful.
 * Bruce still has the like new printer for sale.  Contact him if interested.  Works well on Linux.
