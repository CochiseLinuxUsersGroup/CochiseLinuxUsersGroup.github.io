 * Using Synaptic Package Manager by Rex Bouwense, 28 May
 * Configuring KODI by Gene Zastera, 25 June

**Presentation:**
 * Computer Hardware Maintenance by Jack Thraill
 * Some of the items discussed and demonstrated were; use a soft bristle brush to wipe away some of the dirt, use a air device (or compressed air) to blow out the dust, use a vacuum with a plastic nozzle to suck out the dust and dirt, blow out all of the vents on the computer and monitor, and turn the keyboard upside down to blow out the dirt and dust.

**Discussion:**
 * Gene reminded the group of his difficulty copying very large data files to another disk.  He pointed out that he was using an old disk.  With a newer disk the operation is much smoother.
 * Discussed the advantage advantages and disadvantages of upgrading your computer to a newer version vs re-installation.  In either case you need to back up your data just in case something goes wrong.  If you do not back up your data it is not important because Murphy’s Law may apply.
 * Discussed cleaning your printer and recommended a local shop that does repairs, Toner West.
 * Briefly discussed KODI and the fact that it is in need of some patches. Hopefully it will be patched by the time the presentation is given in June.
 * Briefly discussed Ubuntu Pro.
