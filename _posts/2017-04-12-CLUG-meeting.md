 * Ubuntu 12.04 reaches EOL this month.
 * Lubuntu, Xubuntu 14.04 (all Ubuntu flavors other than the mother of all of them – Ubuntu) will also reach EOL this month.
 
**Discussion:**

 * We have been asked by John DeLalla if we would like to participate in the Water Wise Family Day on 15 April from 1000-1400.  Because of the short notice and the date is the day before Easter it was decided to decline the offer.
 * There was some discussion about lowering the number of CLUG meetings to once a month because of the much lower attendance at the Wednesday meetings.  This is a subject for future discussion.
