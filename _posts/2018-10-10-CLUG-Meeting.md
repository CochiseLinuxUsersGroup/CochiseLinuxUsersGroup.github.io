**Discussion/Problems/Questions:**

 * Email from Brad Edwards:  He was having trouble with his Ubuntu 16.04 installation that we did at a Ubuntu Hour about two years ago.  He was told what he needed to do and given a list of future meetings.
 * Sunsites slide presentation – 2 October.  The presentation went well but the attendance of Sunsites residents was very disappointing.
 * Installfest – 3 November.  Preparations have all been made with the exception of the manning roster which will not be finalized until just before the event.
 * Gene wanted the members to know that he was unable to create a bootable flash drive from a Knoppix ISO but he was able to create a bootable DVD.  Greg told him that was normal for Knoppix.  If he wanted a bootable flash drive he would have to do it from the DVD which has its own installer.
 * Greg recommended that we have a “How To” printed up for the installfest should we have the problem that arose at the previous installfest, Ubuntu will install but not boot.
 * FYI for members that still have a Win10 box.  Microsoft has withdrawn the Fall super update.  Apparently the bug that started deleting data could not be patched in time for the release date.

**Aftermath:**

 * We reconvened at Denny's for some nourishment and additional conversation.
