A computer with Ubuntu 18.04.3 installed was presented to Rusty at the Warrior Healing Center, 1838 Paseo San Luis, Sierra Vista, AZ by Rex.  The computer was donated by Ted and brought back to working condition by other members of the Group to include the installation of the current Ubuntu LTS version.
