**Discussion:**

 * A member had a problem mounting his external hard drive.  That problem was solved and the drive was formatted and partitioned for him.
 * A member had an HP printer problem.  His printer would only print one page of a multi-page document.  Two solutions were  offered.  Install HPLIP to get the new version.  Also, sudo HP-setup -i, has worked in the past.
 * A member had a problem with Chromium crashing his system.  Since he did not have his computer with him it was recommended that he use the software manager to install the browser after he uninstalled what he had currently installed.
 * Discussed whether it was a good idea to store passwords on Firefox.  If you create a Firefox account they can be synced with your account.
