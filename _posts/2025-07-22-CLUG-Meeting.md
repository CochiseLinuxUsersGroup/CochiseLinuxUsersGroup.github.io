**Discussion/Activities:**
 * There was some discussion about moving the Ubuntu Hour from Schlotzski’s to Vinny’s Pizza because of the continual decrease in good service at the restaurant.  A decision will be made at the next event.
 * This was our second attempt to have a social meeting (in lieu of a general meeting) at a local restaurant where spouses, families, and significant others could attend and not be bored to tears by the geeky conversation that was normally part of our meetings.
 * Once again it was decided to continue to have such meetings by those present.
 * The next one is tentatively scheduled for 28 October at 1700 at La Casita, 465 E. Fry Blvd
