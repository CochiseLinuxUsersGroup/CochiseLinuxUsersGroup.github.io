The Cochise Linux User Group, CLUG, in conjunction with the Ubuntu Arizona Local Community Team, AZLOCO, conducted a Linux Workshop/Mini-Installation Festival on Saturday, 12 June 2021 at the Warrior Healing Center, 1838 Paseo San Luis, Sierra Vista AZ.  Eight people attended the event.  The purpose was to install Ubuntu 20.04 on the 3 desktop computers and the 2 laptops that were donated to the group.  These five installations were completed without error.  In addition a member brought his desktop in to have Linux Mint 20.1 installed.  That was also completed without error.  Finally Mac OS Catalina was installed on a MacBook Pro again without error.  Coffee and donuts were present for the attendees.

**PREPARATIONS:**

 * The wired and wireless internet at the Warrior Healing Center is more than adequate for the conduct of our installfests.
 * The group has additional switches, a spare monitor, spare VGA, DVI, and HDMI cables, spare power cables, two spare keyboards (one of which has a P2 connector), and a spare mouse should any be required because an individual failed to bring the necessary equipment.  This box of equipment is always present at our installfests.

**LESSONS LEARNED:**

 * The setup time for one individual was about 45 minutes and only one 8 port switch was used.  Additional assistance would reduce that time considerably.
 * Spare RAM was present, but not needed.  This should always be available.
