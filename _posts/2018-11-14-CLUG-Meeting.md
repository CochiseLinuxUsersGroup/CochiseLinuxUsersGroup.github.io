 http://cochiselinuxusergroup.org/activities/SierraVistaInstallfest_2018-11-03/
 * Discussed meeting location for our Wednesday meetings should we not be allowed to meet at the UA South any longer – Livia’s Coffee House is a prime candidate.  It has wifi and  room for 12 people as well as coffee.
 * Lottery for use of SVPL conference room in 2019 – Rex submitted application 3 Nov, lottery will occur NLT 4 Dec, We will choose our dates 13 Dec.  I will stay with 4th Saturday of each month for meetings and attempt to to get the 1st Saturday of the 2nd month of each quarter for our installfests.  All these will be in the conference room.
 * Discussed possible new “go to” light distros to be used at our installfests for under powered machines.  Members were encouraged to download the ISOs and try these distros and then  submit their comments at a future meeting.
 * Discussed a proposed CLUG Code of Conduct.  Once again members are encouraged to submit their comments at a future meeting.
 * Roland seemed to having a problem getting his wifi to work on his laptop.  Of course without the laptop being present we could only speculate as to the cause.  Possible solutions were presented:  Insure that the wireless button is on.  Insure that networking and wireless are enabled.
 * Roland also asked why Prime 95 appears to be running slower on a Linux box than it did on a Microsoft Windows computer.  Once again without the computer we could only speculate as to the cause.
 * Rex discussed the search engine DuckDuckGo which does not track you like Google does.  Also by adding the plug-in, Privacy Badger, you can also add another layer.

**Aftermath:**

 * We retired to Peter piper Pizza for some pizza and additional conversation.

**DRAFT COCHISE LINUX USER GROUP CODE OF CONDUCT:**

 * Treat all members and guests, without regard to their gender, race, creed, or political affiliation, with respect no matter what their knowledge and experience level happens to be.
 * Treat all questions as important to the individual who is asking.  There may be a simple solution to you, so share it with those who are not as experienced.
 * Disagreements will eventually arise.  Refrain from attacking or belittling those who disagree with you.  Remember, Linux is about choice.  YOUR WAY may be A WAY but perhaps not the ONLY WAY.  Disagreement is no excuse for bad manners.
 * If you don’t know, ask for help.  Don’t try and muddle through, reaching an end result that may or may not be correct.  If asked for help gladly give it.
 * Take responsibility for your actions and statements.  Refrain from those that will cause undue harm or embarrassment.
