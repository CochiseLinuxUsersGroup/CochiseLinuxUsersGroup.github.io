### Meeting Notes:

**Attendees:** 18 (three new individuals)

**Upcoming Events:**

 * 27 July, CLUG Meeting, 1300-1545, SVPL conference room, 2600 East Tacoma Street, Sierra Vista
 * 08 August, Sierra Vista Ubuntu Hour, Schlotzsky's Cafe, 1800-1900, 3900 Fry Blvd, Sierra Vista
 
**Discussion:**

 * Announced that Canonical has withdrawn their statement about no longer supporting x86 ISOâ€™s.  They will continue to support the 32 bit versions beyond 2020.  This of course is good news for Ubuntu users who are still using older machines and perhaps cannot afford a new computer but wish to continue to use Ubuntu.
 * Discussed the possibility of conducting a second repair your computer workshop.  It was decided to hold it at the SV Public Library in lieu of a presentation during Cochise Linux User Group meeting on 24 August from 1300 to 1545.
 * A computer was presented to Jaidon for his personal use.  This is the 12th computer that has been donated to an individual by the group.
 * Since we are getting a greater number of computers, computer parts, and accessories we are actively looking for a place to store them where they can be available to members for repair workshops.  Gene is looking to donate several functional computers.
 * Discussed the feasibility of not conducting quarterly Installfests and doing mini-installfests at the meetings.  This was initially suggested by Devi.  It was decided that this was probably a better use of our resources.  Two installs are already scheduled for the July 27th meeting.
 * Repaired a Ubuntu 18.04 computer install that could not get on the Internet.
 * Recommended video  Why Ubuntu is the Devil and Why So Many No Longer Use It. https://youtu.be/L7uL50zVZJA.  It was initially posted by Devi to the mailing list and parts of it are quite humorous. 
 * Information on Ubuntu, the Cochise Linux User Group, Free and Open Source Software, and AZLOCO was distributed to the new attendees.  Their questions were answered.
