 * Received an email from Bruce Adamson who has moved to Okinawa to accept a new job. He is settling in nicely and will try to stay in contact.
 * The 27 May CLUG meeting will take place at Schlotzsky’s from 1300-1530 since we already have a very good relationship with the folks at Schlotzsky’s and they appreciate our business.  The library will be closed on that day while the entire staff participates in a different city mission.
