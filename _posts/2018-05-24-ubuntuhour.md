**Discussion:**

 * An individual brought in a 2004 Sony Vaio laptop which had Microsoft Windows XP installed on it.  He wanted to install a Linux system on it.  Because it only had 704 Mbs of RAM we tried to install Xubuntu and Lubuntu but the computer would not boot from either a USB flash drive or a DVD install disk.  Possible solutions were discussed and will be acted on at the next meeting.
 * Information on Ubuntu was distributed to the new individuals.
 * Discussed the relative requirements to install Xubuntu and Lubuntu on an older computer.
