### Meeting Notes:  
For those of you that were unable to attend the 05 December Cochise Linux User Group meeting, here are the minutes of the meeting.

The sixth meeting of the Cochise Linux User Group was held at the Sierra Vista public library conference room from 1400-1545. Nine people attended the meeting ( two new people). Paul Bernard introduced the new web site http://cochiselinux.com and the its sub-sections. Please check it out. It was created and is maintained by Jake Strechek and Paul.

Rex Bouwense announced the results of the library lottery for selection of meeting dates in the conference room for the next calendar year. We managed to reserve the 4th Saturday of each month (with the exception of 24 December 2016) for our Saturday meetings from 1400-1545. Our Wednesday meetings at the University will revert back to the 2d Wednesday of each month starting in January.

16 December - C LUG meeting 1700-1800 University of Arizona Sierra Vista campus (classroom C165A North) There will be a presentation on Risk Assessment and Security Analysis by Louie Garcia.

17 December â€“ Ubuntu Hour 1800-1900 hosted by Rex Bouwense at Schlotzsky's Cafe.

Down the Road:

AZLOCO & PLUG co-sponsor an install-fest on the first and third Saturdays of each month. Think about getting a group together and driving up there to meet the folks running the event and to see if we might be interested in running one in Sierra Vista.

Take in and refurbish old computers with a Linux OS for free distribution for the community.
Operate a booth at one or more community activities (The mall, West End Fair, etc).
Computer club presentation for Cochise County high and middle schools.
Run a Linux workshop or install-fest for Sierra Vista/Cochise County.
