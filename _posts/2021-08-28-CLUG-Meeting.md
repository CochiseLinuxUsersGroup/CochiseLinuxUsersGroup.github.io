**Discussion/Problems/Questions:**
 * Ron donated a computer to be re-purposed for the Group’s use.
 * Discussed the Mailing list purge and the reasons behind it.
 * Discussed a new proposed project, The Cochise Linux Distribution Project, where members would use a group laptop to install an assigned Linux Distro,  use it once a week until the next meeting, and then report on it to the membership.  The purpose of course is to introduce members to different Linux distros.
 * Mike gave an update on the project to provide computers to a youth center in Naco, AZ.  It is progressing slowly.  It was recommended that he select a date that some of the members can get together to install Linux on the laptops that he has already accumulated for the project.
 * Discussed possible future presentations of applications that members have used and believe other members could use to their advantage.
