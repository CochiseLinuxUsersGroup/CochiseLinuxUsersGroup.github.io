All of the install media has been updated and checked to insure accuracy.  The manning chart for the Installfest has been finalized.  Publicity for the event has been coordinated with the Sierra Vista Herald/Review, The Cochise Trading Post, and Facebook.  The flyers have been distributed to all members and posted throughout the town and Fort Huachuca.

 * A list of free lectures to be given at the University of Arizona South in the next two months has been distributed to everyone on the mailing list.  Attend them if you are interested in the topic.
