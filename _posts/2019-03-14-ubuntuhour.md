### Meeting Notes:

**Attendees:** 5

**Upcoming Events:**

 * 23 March, CLUG Meeting, 1300-1545, SVPL conference room, 2600 East Tacoma Street, Sierra Vista
 * 11 April, Sierra Vista Ubuntu Hour, Schlotzsky's Cafe, 1800-1900, 3900 Fry Blvd, Sierra Vista
 
**Discussion:**

 * Discussed the upcoming Installfest at Liviaâ€™s Coffee on 04 May.
 * A member discussed a problem that he had with a Western Digital 1 Tb hard drive that he had been using for storage which apparently caused the desktop to freeze.   After a hard shutdown, the computer restarted with no apparent damage to anything but the storage hard drive.  (The hard drive died and has subsequently been discarded.)   Interesting since the hard drive was not that old and was not subject to multiple mounting and unmounting.
 * Also discussed was the inability to get an Epson ET-2550 printer to function correctly on a Ubuntu System after doing everything that the Epson website said to do and trying multiple drivers.
