**Future Presentations:**
 * TBA, "How to check the SHA256SUM on a downloaded ISO" by Rex Bouwense
 * TBA, "Using Alias" by David Garcia
 * TBA, "Using Remmina" by Rex Bouwense
 * TBA, "Using a Virtual Machine" by Rex Bouwense

**Presentation:**
 * "Ventoy" by Rex Bouwense (The presentation was canceled because those in attendance were already using Ventoy)  The slides may be found on our web site https://cochiselinuxusergroup.org/  under the resources tab. 

**Discussion/Activities:**
 * Discussed the Warrior Healing Center's Facebook comments about the CLUG.  Rex will personally thank Cathie.
 * Discussed a possible change in CLUG meeting format.  Instead of having a meeting every month with a presentation.  It was decided to try to have a meeting with the wives and friends at a restaurant where we could socialize with each other.  The meeting on 22 April will be at Native Grill at 1700 (5 pm.).  Families are invited and while discussion about Linux is not forbidden it will be discouraged.  This will be a test of the new format to see if we can improve the turnout.  If successful we may move to this format with perhaps a social event once a quarter replacing a meeting.
 * A member stated that when he was copying data from his computer to a flash drive, he received no indication that the copy process was completed. When he tried to unmount the flash drive he received a notification that there was still writing to be done to the flash drive and that he was not to remove it.  This is a normal situation.  If the data transfer was very large the computer was probably still checking the hash for the transfer.  The notice should disappear when the transfer and the hash check is complete.  You can unmount/eject the flash drive after the notice disappears.


**Aftermath:**
 * Several of the members retired to Culver's for some food and some additional Linux discussion.
