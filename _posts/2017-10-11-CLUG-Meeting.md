**Discussion:**

 * The Cochise Linux mailing list can be used for many things other than announcing meetings and events.  David Garcia has recently used it for passing interesting articles and URLs to the membership.  It can be used for asking questions or presenting solutions to problems. Make use of it.  There is a wealth of experience out there.
 * There will be a renovation of the Learning Resource Center some time after 01 November so we may be meeting at a different location next month.  Information will be provided to the membership as it becomes available.
 * The Introduction to the Command Line presentation (part 2) was given by Rex Bouwense.

**Aftermath:**

 * Because most of the members present had other obligations no restaurant was chosen for an after meeting bite to eat.
