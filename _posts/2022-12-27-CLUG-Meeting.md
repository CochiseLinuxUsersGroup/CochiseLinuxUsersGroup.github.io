**Discussion/Problems/Questions:**
 * A member has had a problem with the size of the cursor displaying the same size when he opened VLC.  To correct the probleom he had to uninstall VLC and reinstall it from the VLC website.  Either that or living with the change in size.  Installing it from the software store does not correct the problem.
