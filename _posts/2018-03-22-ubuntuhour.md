**Discussion:**

 * Discussed the upcoming Installfest (co-sponsored by AZLOCO and CLUG) on 28 April 2018. The preparations are on track.  We will be using Ubuntu 16.04.4 install media.  There simply isn’t sufficient time to prepare and test the Ubuntu 18.04 versions which will be released on the 26th.  Individuals will be provided with information on how to upgrade or they can contact any member for assistance.
 * Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver will be released by Canonical on the 26th of April (the day of our April Ubuntu Hour).  As with any new releases I expect it to be a little buggy.  I would refrain from placing it on your machines until the testers have had an opportunity to iron out any wrinkles that may exist, unless of course you want to be a tester.
 * Our own Release Party for Bionic Beaver:  After the installfest I would like to retire to Native Grill and Wings to celebrate the release.  Any and all folks who assisted at the installfest are invited to attend.  That would be roughly 1600-1800.
 * AZLOCO and CLUG participation in the West End Fair this year will be limited to passing out flyers stating who we are and what we do.  The search continues for new community projects to spread the word about Ubuntu, Linux, and FOSS.
 * There was a general discussion on member problems and the various ways to secure solutions.  The best way is to bring the computer to a CLUG meeting or a Ubuntu Hour.  However, there are other options.  Both AZLOCO and CLUG have IRC channels on freenode.net (#Ubuntu-US-AZ and #cochiselinux respectively)where questions can be raised.  Both AZLOCO and CLUG have a mailing list that can be used to present problems and find solutions.  Most, if not all Linux distros, have forums that are devoted to solving problems that individuals have with their computers.  Ubuntu’s forums are at  https://ubuntuforums.org/.
 * The CLUG has a page that has member photos and very short Bios.  It is an opt in page but I encourage you to submit a short Bio and photo if you so desire to either Rex or Devi to be included on the page.  Of course if you have outstanding warrants or a former spouse or ex-partner that is looking for you we will understand.  If you want to make changes to your current Bio, once again contact Rex or Devi with your change(s) and they will make any necessary corrections.  
 * The CLUG meeting on the 24th (Saturday) will include a presentation by Chad Wheeler, a Penetration Tester for Campus Guard, a company focused on PCI Compliance and Information Security and Consulting Services for Higher Education.    There will be a group from the Phoenix area that will be driving down to attend our meeting.  Todd Cole and Walter Mack should be among the attendees.  If you have not met these guys take some time to introduce yourself. They are super knowledgeable.  Other possible attendees are pavlos and collie.
