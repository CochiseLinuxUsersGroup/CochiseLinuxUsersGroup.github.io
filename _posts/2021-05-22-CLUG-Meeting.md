**Discussion/Problems/Questions:**
 * A member had a problem with running out of space on his 16 GB netbook.  While it recognized a USB flash drive he could not move his /home or any documents there.   Something was obviously taking up a great deal of space on his hard drive.  Since time was limited and it was a fresh install, we recommended a re-install of the OS. 
 * Mike wanted to invite all members to his grand opening in Naco on 04 June.  Details to follow via email.
