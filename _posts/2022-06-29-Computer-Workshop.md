The Cochise Linux User Group, CLUG, conducted a Computer Workshop on Wednesday, 29 June 2022 at the Warrior Healing Center, 1838 Paseo San Luis, Sierra Vista AZ.  Six people attended the event.  One new person.

**PREPARATIONS:**

 * The Group had received a donation of 11 desktop computers from Mike. 
 * Since we had just had an installfest and one was not scheduled for a while, volunteers were asked to show up at the Warrior Healing Center to sort and test the equipment.

**ACTIVITIES:**

 * All 11 desktop computers were cleaned and tested for use.  Eight were found to be usable (Two of these were 32 bit only)
 * Since monitors were not donated and we only have 2 on hand, we are in need of 6 monitors to be able to donate these computers when they are completed.
 * We are also in need of eight mice for these computers.
 * The 3 that are not usable will be used for parts.
 * One additional SATA hard drive was also donated.  It was taken out of one of the computers which had two hard drives installed.
