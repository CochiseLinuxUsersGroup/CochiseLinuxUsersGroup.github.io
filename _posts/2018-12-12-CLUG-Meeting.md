**Future Presentations:**

**Presentation:**  
 * Trisquel by Greg Christ
 * No proprietary applications are used in the default install but since it is based on Debian/Ubuntu all of their applications can be installed.
 * It is relatively easy to install.  No hangups or problems were encountered during the 30 minute install.  The Mini version comes with lxde and can be installed on any computer made after 1999.  The specific minimum RAM requirements are 256 Mb for a 32 bit version and 512 Mb for a 64 bit version.  1-2 Gb are recommended.  
 * Trisquel has a forum but is is relatively small and there do not appear to be a great deal of users who use it. 
 * It was Greg’s opinion that Trisquel should remain as a candidate for our “Go To” light distribution to install at our installfests.

**Discussion/Problems/Questions:**

 * Tomorrow is the selection date to reserve rooms at the library for 2019.  We will attempt to select the 4th Saturday of each month from 1300-1545.  Also we will attempt to get the 1st Saturday of February, May, August, and November 1000-1545 for our installfests.  The search for other locations continues.  Rex will be there to represent the Group.  Anyone else who is free is also welcome to attend.
 * A gentleman, first name Bruce, from Bisbee recently became a follower of the Cochise Linux User Group Facebook page.  He wanted assistance with several projects in Tucson and Bisbee that would involve putting together a Linux network for him to provide Internet to customers at a price.  He was told him that the Group would not get involved but the would the question would be raised at our next meeting and if anyone was interested in assisting him they would contact him directly.  No one was interested in taking on that project.
 * Cody had a problem with successfully connecting two monitors while gaming because neither one of them had an HDMI connection and his tower only has only one DVI socket to connect one monitor.  Solutions offered in jest were buy a new monitor and get rid of Microsoft Windows.  David came up with the ultimate solution, at Peter Piper Pizza.  See below.

**Aftermath:**

 * We retired to Peter Piper Pizza to enjoy some pizza and some additional conversation where David came up with the ultimate solution to Cody’s problem, a monitor with an HDMI connection which he presented to Cody (much to the displeasure of Lynn).
