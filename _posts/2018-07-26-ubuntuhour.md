**Discussion:**

 * The first point release for Ubuntu 18.04 was due to be released today.  It is solid and you may if you wish do a distribution upgrade from 16.04 LTS to 18.04 LTS.  Be sure and back up your data to an external source just in case Murphy is in attendance.
 * Discussed the differences between the LTS Ubuntu releases and the interim releases (which are only supported for 9 months).  Of course Ubuntu 16.04 LTS is a very solid release and will be continued to be supported until April of 2021 so there is no urgent need to upgrade if  you do not want to.
 * 17 of the 27 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS flash drives have been upgraded from 16.04 to 18.04 in anticipation of the 4 August installfest.  We are waiting the results of the other 10.
 * Discussed the preparations for the Installfest and the manning requirements.  Everything appears to be ready and while no snags are anticipated there are plans in place to cover problems that may develop.
 * Discussed a possible topic for a future presentation “Personal Security for your Computer”. Occasionally the simplest things are often overlooked.  It was suggested that perhaps some of the members may need a refresher on PC Security.
 * Discussed the procedures and methods to install upgrades.
