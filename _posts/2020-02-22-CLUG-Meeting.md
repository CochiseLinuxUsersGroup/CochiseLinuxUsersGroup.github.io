**Discussion/Problems/Questions:**

 * Six CLUG members attended the IEEE free presentation on AI vs Humans at the UA South on 27 January.
 * The Installfest brochures have been printed and are ready for distribution next week.
 * The CLUG caps have been ordered and will be ready for pick-up NLT this Friday.
 * All installation media have been updated and are ready for the Installfest.
 * Dan is still having problems installing a Linux system on his ACER that only has a 16 GB hard drive.  Once again it was recommended that he try Bodhi Linux or any of the other Light distros that have been previously recommended.
 * Charles wanted to know if he could get rid of the icons that are displayed when he boots from a live CD (flash drive).  Since they are generally used to install a distro, the flash drive boots into RAM so changes or updates are not saved.
 * Pat is still trying to get his Epson 835 Artisan printer to print a a brighter photo.  The driver that he downloaded would not install because of unresolved dependencies.  It may not have been the correct driver.  If it was the correct driver then the dependencies have to be installed as well.  If there is more than one driver listed and/or recommended they should all be tried.  Otto said that he had a similar printer and he had to try several drivers.
 * Bill donated a desktop computer to be repaired if possible, have a Linux distro installed, and have it donated to an individual

**Aftermath:**

 * Several of the members retired to 143 Street Tacos for some nourishment and some additional conversation on Linux and non-Linux topics.
