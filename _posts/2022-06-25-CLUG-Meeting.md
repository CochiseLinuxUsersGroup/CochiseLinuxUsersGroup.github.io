**Presentation:**   
 * The CLUG Mailing List by Rex Bouwense (The presentation was canceled because of  the lack of attendance.

**Discussion/Problems/Questions:**
 * We discussed the creation of the Cochise Linux Google Group;  what it is, how to join, and if we should re-issue the invitations to join. What we have now is the first draft and it is a good start.  Once you join all you have to do is open your Google Drive and select “shared with me” to see the documents that have been created so far.  Among them are an inventory of the spare parts and accessories that the CLUG has on hand, a request for topics to be covered at our meetings, requests for assistance.  Remember however that this is the first draft.  There is more to come and things will change and grow.  Bruce is the creator and author of the great majority of the information that is already published.  If you have comments please share them.
 * We discussed several possible ways to increase the attendance at the monthly meetings;  give those attending a certain number of meetings some prize,  conduct a raffle at our meetings.  Anyone with ideas please share them.
