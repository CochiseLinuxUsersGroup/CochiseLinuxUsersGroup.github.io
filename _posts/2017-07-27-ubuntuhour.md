 * The next Installfest is tentatively scheduled for October of this year.  Right now there are events scheduled for the 1st Saturday (Art in the Park), the second Saturday (Gem and Mineral Show).  That leaves only the 21st and the 28th as possible dates.
 * The time frame 1000-1600 is still valid for now but bares looking at for a possible change
 * Discussed the new Debian concept of being able to choose your Desktop Environment at installation.
 * Discussed the next point release for Ubuntu 16.04 scheduled for 8 August.  All of the install media has to be updated to reflect the new release, 16.04.3.
 
**Activities:**

 * The new Penguin made his inaugural appearance at the Ubuntu Hour.
 * One of the members inadvertently locked her keys in her car so we spent 30 minutes after the meeting attempting to open the car with wire, cable, a broom, and a few other items.  With 9 people present, there were 9 different solutions because we are group of Linux users who use different distros.   The solution was the old standard, the coat hanger.
