**Discussion:**

 * Ubuntu SWAG and information about the CLUG, AZLOCO, and FOSS equivelents was passed out to the new attendees. 
 * Discussed the use of the mailing list to solve computer problems.  Rex Bouwense will compose an email for the group on how to do it and what we expect when you ask a question.
 * As has been reported already the CLUG has the library conference room reserved on the  4th Saturday of each month for the next calendar year for its meetings.  In addition we have obtained a couple of POCs in the library system should we require their assistance if we decide to hold an installfest in the library system.
 * An experiment was conducted to see if we could create a wired LAN in the library from only a WiFi connection.  The original attempt was a failure but a second attempt by one of our new guests proved successful.
 * Unfortunately we have yet to come up with the requisite 20 T-shirt orders so we will go with what we have and hopefully we will have then before Christmas.

**Aftermath:**
 * We reconvened at Peter Piper Pizza for some nourishment and additional conversation on Linux related subjects as well as how attempting to herd a large group of very small children was very like attempting to herd cats.
