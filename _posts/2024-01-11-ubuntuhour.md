### Date: Thursday, 11 January 2024

### Meeting Notes:

**Attendees:** 6.

**Upcoming Events:**
 * 23 January, CLUG Meeting, 1700-1800, Warrior Healing Center, main conference room, 1838 Paseo San Luis, Sierra Vista.  The presentation will be "Maintaining Your Computer Hardware."
 * 08 February, Sierra Vista Ubuntu Hour, 1800-1900, Schlotzsky's Cafe, 3900 Fry Blvd, Sierra Vista.

**Announcements:**
 * To date we have donated 120 computers to individuals or groups and conducted 187 installs on laptops and desktops.
 * We have 44 people on our mailing list and 37 members on our Facebook page.
 * We have 3 desktop computers ready for donation.

**Discussion:**
 * There will be another purge of the mailing list later in the month.  If you respond within 14 days you will remain on the list.  Failure to do so will result in your name being deleted.
 * Discussed optimal dates for our next Installfest.  Since there will be a new release of Ubuntu on the 25th of April we will conduct one in the Warrior Healing Centerâ€™s computer lab to update those computers to 24.04 in the May/June time frame.  The question of whether we wanted to have one earlier was put on hold until the next meeting.
 * An attendee has a desktop computer with a case fan that is quite noisy and appears to be failing.  He will make arrangements next week to have it replaced.
 * The election of a new Local Community Council has taken place.  Perhaps we will now have some action and support from them.
