### Location: Bisbee Senior Center

### Meeting Minutes:

**Attendees:** 16 (six new persons)

**Upcoming CLUG Events:**

 * 13 August, Ubuntu Hour, 1800-1900, Schlotzsky's Cafe, 3900 E. Fry Blvd., Sierra Vista (Subject to change depending on the Covid-19 situation)
 * 22 August, CLUG Meeting, 1300-1530, (Location TBA)
 
**Future Presentations:**

 * What to do if Ubuntu won’t Boot by Rex Bouwense, 22 August
 * Different ways to install a program on a Linux OS by Greg Christ - TBD 
 * Do a hands on installation with a group member acting as a client by Rex Bouwense – TBD
 * The Contents of Some Linux Directories by Rex Bouwense - TBD
 * How to build a computer by Ted Janecki, TBD
 * Robo Linux by Tim Kirk, TBD

**Recent Linux/FOSS News Items:**

 * Ubuntu 20.04.1 is scheduled to be released 06 August.
 * Linux Mint 20.0 has been released and the install media has been updated.  They no longer support 32 bit releases so we will continue to use Linux Mint 19.3 or Linux Mint Debian Edition 4 (which are supported until 2023) for 32 bit machines.  None of the 20.04 Ubuntu flavors have 32 bit releases so they are no longer viable as our go since the ones that are still supported (Xubuntu and Lubuntu) reach EOL in April of 2021.  There still exists Bodhi Linux 5.1, AnntiX 19.2, and MXLinux 19.2 that are still supporting 32 bit machines but the days of 32 bit OS’s are probably numbered if not very close to GONE.
 
**Activities:**

 * Since there were some folks that had brought their computers and wanted an Linux distro installed on them and Rex was unable to get the presentation to display on the TV it was decided to dedicate the meeting to the installations.  The result was a mini-Installation Festival.
 * There were four successful installations completed, two Ubuntu 20.04 and two Linux Mint 20.0 XFCE.  All of the clients were very satisfied with the results.
 * We introduced the Put and Take Box which will be available at all of our events for members to take any accessory that they need and to put any that they no longer have a need for.  As of this time there are power cords, USB cords, converters, RAM chips, keyboards, mice, USB hubs, a bluetooth keyboard, VGA cords, DVI cords, HDMI cords, and a host of other items.  Not in the box but still available are 15 laptop AC adapters with power cords. The concept was introduced by Devi and he gets all the credit for its introduction.  Hats off to our Segundo.
 * The new attendees were provided with information on the CLUG and a list of Linux equivalent programs to Windows programs currently in use as well as some Ubuntu SWAG.
