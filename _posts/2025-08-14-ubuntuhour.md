**Discussion and Activities:**
 * Discussed a WiFi problem with a Dell laptop that has a Broadcom  BCM43 chip.  The solution can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
 * Discussed a search problem that a member was having.  Provided him with a possible solution using the wild card *.
 * Bruce A will be leaving us for Okinawa on 1 September.  He has a brand new Canon TS 3288 ink jet printer that works well with Linux distros.  He is willing to sell it for $50. If interested please respond on the mailing list.  Thanks for all of your input Bruce.  We are all sorry to see you leave.
 * Discussed a new format for the monthly meetings.  Since we have always had a good turnout at our workshops and we have not had one for a while, we will changing one of our meetings every quarter into a Linux Workshop.  So each quarter we will have a regular meeting, a dinner meeting (where spouses are cordially invited to attend), and a Linux workshop (where people can bring in their equipment and have problems solved). The first one of the workshops will take place in September at the Warrior Healing Center main conference room.
 * Since there were not sufficient people present the discussion on moving the Ubuntu Hour to a new location was tabled until the next meeting.
