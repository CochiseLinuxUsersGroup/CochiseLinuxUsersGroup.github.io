### Meeting Notes:
The Cochise Linux User Group, CLUG, in conjunction with the Ubuntu Arizona Local Community Team, AZLOCO, conducted an Installation Festival on Saturday, 20 May 2023 at the Warrior Healing Center, 1838 Paseo San Luis, Sierra Vista AZ.  Eight people attended the event. In addition we were connected via Big Blue Button to a virtual Installfest conducted by AZLOCO on line.

**PREPARATIONS:**

 * The wired and wireless internet at the Warrior Healing Center was once again more than adequate for the conduct of our installfests.
 * The group had additional switches, a spare monitor, spare VGA, DVI, and HDMI cables, spare power cables, two spare keyboards (one of which has a PS2 connector), and a spare mouse should any be required.  This box of equipment is always present at our installfests.
 * Tools and spare CMOS batteries were present.
 * Spare RAM and hard drives were available should any computer require them.  (One computer required a hard drive and 2 computers required a RAM upgrade.)

**ACTIVITIES:**

 * The set up took less than 20 minutes with 4 people involved.
 * There were 2 donated computers present for installation.  One was deemed unusable.
 * Five installs were completed. (1 Ubuntu 22.04, 1 Kubuntu 22.04, 1 Lubuntu 22.04, 1 Linx Mint Debian Edition, and 1 Bodhi Linux)
 * A HP printer/scanner was configured for an attendee
 * One desktop computer was donated to an attendee.
