**Discussion:**
 * A member asked how much hand holding do we do after an installation of a Linux OS.  Since most people rarely do anything more than search the web, watch videos, check their email, and occasionally create a document, very little.  We do however, give them an install packet which explains how to get on our mailing list, when and where are events take place, and some basic information about the operating system and Linux.
 * Discussed the Installfest preparations to date.
 * Discussed email clients and email providers, specifically Thunderbird and its capabilities.
