**Discussion:**

 * CLUG T-shirts were on hand and passed out to members in attendance.
 * New member information on the CLUG was passed out to the 2 new people in attendance.
 * The Library has graciously offered the big room to the CLUG to hold installfests (on 28 April, 04 August, and 03 November from 1000-1530).  This will perhaps enable us to reach an additional audience.
 * Helen Patterson wanted to know how to change her Home Page and how to change her administrative password.  Both questions were answered to her satisfaction.

**Presentation:**

 * How to change your administrative password – Rex Bouwense
 
**Aftermath:**
