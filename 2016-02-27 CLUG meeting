### Meeting Notes:

**Attendees:** 6

**Upcoming Events:**

* 09 March CLUG meeting, 1700-1800 hours, University of Arizona South, classroom B159.  May be canceled.  More information to follow.

Those present were asked to come up with a list of presentation subjects that they would like to hear.

To date there are no presentations scheduled for the month of March.

Down the road â€“ AZLOCO & PLUG co-sponsor an install-fest on the first & third Saturdays of each month.  We are welcome to attend.  Louie and I attended one and I would like to get together another group to car pool up to Tempe.

Any thoughts on the proposed community projects. Perhaps we need to re-think community projects because there appears to be little interest. 
 * Re-furbishing computers with Linux OS and donating them. (Leo)
 * A presentation for high/middle school computer clubs. (Janet).  Since the school year has progressed this might well be looked at for the next term.
 * Attendance at local events in the way of a booth.  (West End Fair and Festival of the Southwest)

David thought that perhaps if we could get a larger room for a longer time period and we could convince the folks in Phoenix to provide assistance we could run our own install-fest.

There is a Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) release party scheduled for 14 May from 1500 until ? in Chandler.  The release date is 21 April.  I plan on driving up there so we can probably get together a car pool list for that.  It is more of a social event and the intent is to meet and greet although wifi will be available to install the new release should anyone want to do that.

I have talked to a financial planner who is willing to give us a short FREE talk on financial planning.  While it does some of us old guys a little good, it could really benefit you younger folks.  As a minimum it could provide you with information that will enable you to make decisions more intelligently.  I will schedule her for 26 March.

**Recent LInux/Foss News Items Discussion:**

Mint 17.3 Cinnamon (both 32 and 64 bit) hacked on 20 Feb 16.  If you downloaded the ISO on that date and didn't use a torrent, it is bogus.  Check the MD5Sum and you will see that the hashes do not match.  The mirror was taken down.  http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2994.

We adjourned the meeting to the Pizza Hut where we enjoyed some food and some excellent conversation.
