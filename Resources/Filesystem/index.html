<br><br><br>
<h2>Linux File Hierarchy Structure<h2><br>
The Linux File Hierarchy Structure or the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems.It is maintained by the Linux Foundation.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>In the FHS, all files and directories appear under the root directory /, even if they are stored on different physical or virtual devices.</li>
<li>Some of these directories only exist on a particular system if certain subsystems, such as the X Window System, are installed.</li>
<li>Most of these directories exist in all UNIX operating systems and are generally used in much the same way; however, the descriptions here are those used specifically for the FHS, and are not considered authoritative for platforms other than Linux.</li><br>
</ul>
<br>

<br>
/ (Root) : Primary hierarchy root and root directory of the entire file system hierarchy.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Every single file and directory starts from the root directory</li>
  <li>Only root user has the right to write under this directory</li>
  <li>/root is root user’s home directory, which is not same as /</li>
</ul>
<br>
/bin : Essential command binaries that need to be available in single user mode; for all users, e.g., cat, ls, cp.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Contains binary executables</li>
<li>Common linux commands you need to use in single-user modes are located under this directory.</li>
  <li>Commands used by all the users of the system are located here e.g. ps, ls, ping, grep, cp</li>
</ul>
<br>
/boot : Boot loader files, e.g., kernels, initrd.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Kernel initrd, vmlinux, grub files are located under /boot</li>
  <li>Example: initrd.img-2.6.32-24-generic, vmlinuz-2.6.32-24-generic</li>
</ul>
<br>
/dev : Essential device files, e.g., /dev/null.<br>
<ul>
  <li>These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.</li>
  <li>Example: /dev/tty1, /dev/usbmon0</li>
</ul>
<br>
/etc : Host-specific system-wide configuration files.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Contains configuration files required by all programs.</li>
<li>This also contains startup and shutdown shell scripts used to start/stop individual programs.</li>
  <li>Example: /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/logrotate.conf.</li>
</ul>
<br>
/home : Users’ home directories, containing saved files, personal settings, etc.<br>
<ul>
<li>Home directories for all users to store their personal files.</li>
  <li>example: /home/kishlay, /home/kv</li>
</ul>
<br>
/lib : Libraries essential for the binaries in /bin/ and /sbin/.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Library filenames are either ld* or lib*.so.*</li>
  <li>Example: ld-2.11.1.so, libncurses.so.5.7</li>
</ul>
<br>
/media : Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs (appeared in FHS-2.3).<br>
<ul>
  <li>Temporary mount directory for removable devices.</li>
<li>Examples, /media/cdrom for CD-ROM; /media/floppy for floppy drives; /media/cdrecorder for CD writer</li>
</ul>
<br>
/mnt : Temporarily mounted filesystems.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Temporary mount directory where sysadmins can mount filesystems.</li>
  </ul>
<br>
/opt : Optional application software packages.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Contains add-on applications from individual vendors.</li>
  <li>Add-on applications should be installed under either /opt/ or /opt/ sub-directory.</li>
</ul>
<br>
/sbin : Essential system binaries, e.g., fsck, init, route.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Just like /bin, /sbin also contains binary executables.</li>
<li>The linux commands located under this directory are used typically by system aministrator, for system maintenance purpose.</li>
  <li>Example: iptables, reboot, fdisk, ifconfig, swapon</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
/srv : Site-specific data served by this system, such as data and scripts for web servers, data offered by FTP servers, and repositories for version control systems.<br>
<ul>
  <li>srv stands for service.</li>
<li>Contains server specific services related data.</li>
  <li>Example, /srv/cvs contains CVS related data.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
/tmp : Temporary files. Often not preserved between system reboots, and may be severely size restricted.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Directory that contains temporary files created by system and users.</li>
  <li>Files under this directory are deleted when system is rebooted.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
/usr : Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of (multi-)user utilities and applications.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Contains binaries, libraries, documentation, and source-code for second level programs.</li>
<li>/usr/bin contains binary files for user programs. If you can’t find a user binary under /bin, look under /usr/bin. For example: at, awk, cc, less, scp</li>
<li>/usr/sbin contains binary files for system administrators. If you can’t find a system binary under /sbin, look under /usr/sbin. For example: atd, cron, sshd, useradd, userdel</li>
  <li>/usr/lib contains libraries for /usr/bin and /usr/sbin</li>
<li>/usr/local contains users programs that you install from source. For example, when you install apache from source, it goes under /usr/local/apache2</li>
  <li>/usr/src holds the Linux kernel sources, header-files and documentation.</li>
  </ul>
/proc : Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files. In Linux, corresponds to a procfs mount. Generally automatically generated and populated by the system, on the fly.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Contains information about system process.</li>
<li>This is a pseudo filesystem contains information about running process. For example: /proc/{pid} directory contains information about the process with that particular pid.</li>
<li>This is a virtual filesystem with text information about system resources. For example: /proc/uptime</li>
  </ul>
<br><Br>
Modern Linux distributions include a /run directory as a temporary filesystem (tmpfs) which stores volatile runtime data, following the FHS version 3.0. According to the FHS version 2.3, such data were stored in /var/run but this was a problem in some cases because this directory is not always available at early boot. As a result, these programs have had to resort to trickery, such as using /dev/.udev, /dev/.mdadm, /dev/.systemd or /dev/.mount directories, even though the device directory isn’t intended for such data.Among other advantages, this makes the system easier to use normally with the root filesystem mounted read-only. For example, below are the changes Debian made in its 2013 Wheezy release:<br>
<ul>
<li>/dev/.* ? /run/*</li>
<li>/dev/shm ? /run/shm</li>
<li>/dev/shm/* ? /run/*</li>
<li>/etc/* (writeable files) ? /run/*</li>
<li>/lib/init/rw ? /run</li>
<li>/var/lock ? /run/lock</li>
<li>/var/run ? /run</li>
  <li>/tmp ? /run/tmp</li>
  </ul>
