Linux File Hierarchy Structure<br>
The Linux File Hierarchy Structure or the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems.It is maintained by the Linux Foundation.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>In the FHS, all files and directories appear under the root directory /, even if they are stored on different physical or virtual devices.</li>
<li>Some of these directories only exist on a particular system if certain subsystems, such as the X Window System, are installed.</li>
<li>Most of these directories exist in all UNIX operating systems and are generally used in much the same way; however, the descriptions here are those used specifically for the FHS, and are not considered authoritative for platforms other than Linux.</li><br>
</ul>
