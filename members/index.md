# **Matt Eskes** - Member  

*IRC Nick*:  meskes  
*Bio*:  Matt began his journey into the world of Free and Open Source 
Software shortly after Netscape opened the source code to 
Netscape Navigator, in 1998. His first distribution was Red Hat  
Linux 5.2 with version 2.0 of the Linux Kernel. Since then, he 
has used and/or contributed to many various open source 
projects, including:  
  
Ubuntu — He worked with the s'Bug Squad” where he help to track  
down bugs in the Beta releases of the OS, reported on them, and  
helped reproduce the particular issues, in order to develop 
fixes for the bugs. He was also a member of the Ubuntu the 
Arizona Ubuntu LoCo for two years, which helps expose users
to the Free and Open Source Software community.  
  
Fedora — He was a former package maintainer for Fingerprint 
GUI, which was a package that controlled the the fingerprint 
scanner on the Sony Viao line of computers. He worked with the 
maintainer of the package to help insure consistency of the 
package between both distributions. He also helped the Fedora 
security team detect and work on SELinux, a Linux Security 
Module Framework which helps harden the system to the 
exploitation and execution of arbitrary code, in order achieve 
superuser permissions on the targeted system.  
  
Other distributions of note that he's worked with are:  
  
Gentoo Linux  
Debian GNU/Linux  
Mandrake Open Linux  
CyanogenMOD (Android)  
  
Since then, he's made the move over to Mac OS X for his desktop  
systems, and he currently uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux on his 
servers as well as FreeBSD on the systems that he uses for his 
core networking services.  
  
Matt can be reached any time by email with questions and advice, 
by sending a self-addressed, stamped email
