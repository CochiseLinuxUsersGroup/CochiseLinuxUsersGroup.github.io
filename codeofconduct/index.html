        <h2><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></h2>
</header>
<li>Treat all members and guests with respect, regardless of their gender, race, beliefs, or political views, and no matter their level of knowledge or experience.</li>
<li>Recognize that every Linux or FOSS question is important to the person asking. What might seem like a simple solution to you could be a big help to someone less experienced, so share your knowledge freely.</li>
<li>Disagreements are bound to happen. Avoid attacking or belittling those who disagree with you. Remember, Linux is all about choice. YOUR way might be one option, but not the only one. Disagreement doesn’t justify poor manners.</li>
<li>If you're unsure about something, ask for help. Don’t try to figure it out on your own if it might lead to a wrong outcome. If someone asks for assistance, be happy to offer it.</li>
<li>Own your actions and words. Avoid saying or doing things that could cause unnecessary harm or embarrassment.</li>
