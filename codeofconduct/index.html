        <h2><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></h2>
</header>
<li>Treat all members and guests, without regard to their gender, race, creed, or political affiliation, with respect no matter what their knowledge and experience level happens to be.</li>
<li>Treat all Linux or FOSS questions as important to the individual who is asking.  There may be a simple solution to you, so share it with those who are not as experienced.</li>
<li>Disagreements will eventually arise.  Refrain from attacking or belittling those who disagree with you.  Remember, Linux is about choice.  YOUR WAY may be A WAY but perhaps not the ONLY WAY.  Disagreement is no excuse for bad manners.</li>
<li>If you don’t know, ask for help.  Don’t try and muddle through, reaching an end result that may or may not be correct.  If asked for help gladly give it.</li>
<li>Take responsibility for your actions and statements.  Refrain from those that will cause undue harm or embarrassment.</li>
