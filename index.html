        <h1> Welcome to CLUG</h1>
        <p class="lead">We are a volunteer non-profit organization of Linux users from Cochise County, Arizona. Our goals are to provide a platform for Linux users to talk with other Linux users about their problems and questions, to attend presentations from other members as well as outside vendors about Free and Open Source Software, and to have a place where they can increase their education to enable them to obtain a better job or increase the efficiency of their own organization.</p>
