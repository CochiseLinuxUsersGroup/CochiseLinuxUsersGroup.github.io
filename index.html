<p class="text-center">We are a volunteer organization of Linux users from Cochise County, Arizona. Our goals are to provide a platform for Linux users to talk with other Linux users about their problems and questions, to host presentations from members as well as outside individuals about Free and Open Source Software, and to expand the use of Linux Operating Systems on personal computers through out the county.</p>

                   We host a monthly Ubuntu Hour and conduct one group meeting each month where we give presentations and discuss / troubleshoot anyone's Linux questions. All of our events are (and always will be) free of any cost and open to the public, catering to any skill level or technology background. Our presentations cover a variety of topics, from beginner to advanced (even specialized topics given by Linux professionals). Check out our calendar for a list of upcoming events.</p>
