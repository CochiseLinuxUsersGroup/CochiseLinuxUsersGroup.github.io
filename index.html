                   We hold two meetings per month where we give presentations and discuss / troubleshoot anyone's Linux questions. Our meetings are (and always will be) free of any cost and open to the public, catering to any skill level or technology background. Our presentations cover a variety of topics, from beginner to advanced (even specialized topics given by Linux professionals). Check out our calendar for a list of upcoming meetings.</p>
