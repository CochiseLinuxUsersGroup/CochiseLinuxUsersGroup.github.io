Because of the existing interest in painted rocks in Sierra Vista, it was thought that we should place a few out to get some free publicity.  Each was emblazoned with the Ubuntu LoGo, our name, and our web site, cochiselinux.com

With all of the rocks that were hidden found, it was decided to place a few more out in the city to see if we could generate and additional members for the CLUG.
