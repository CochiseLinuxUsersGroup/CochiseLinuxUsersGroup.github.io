The Cochise Linux User Group, CLUG, in conjunction with the Ubuntu Arizona Local Community Team, AZLOCO, conducted an Installation Festival on Saturday, 04 August at the Sierra Vista Public Library Mona Bishop room.  Fourteen people attended the event which resulted in two installs (GalliumOS and Lubuntu).  In addition a BIOS was updated for an attendee.  Individuals were provided with information on Linux, AZLOCO, and CLUG.  Ubuntu SWAG was also distributed.

**PREPERATIONS:**

* Coordination was done with Susan Abend, Adult Services Librarian, Leisure & Library Services, Sierra Vista Public Library, for use of the Mona Bishop room about four month in advance.  We also have the room for the 3 November Installfest.
      
* Publicizing the event started approximately two months before the event and took the form of flyers that were posted in various locations around town and the Education Center on Fort Huachuca, posting a notice in the Cochise Trading Post, posting a notice on the Sierra Vista Herald/Reviewâ€™s on line web site (http://www.svherald.com/calendar/#/), and sending copies of the flyer to the CLUG mailing list for distribution to their friends and neighbors and at their places of employment and worship.

 * Hardware for the event was on hand from previous Installfests that was donated by various members of the CLUG and AZLOCO.
 
 * Installation media in the form of, DVDs and USB thumb drives, was on hand from previous Installfests and was updated to the new versions (Ubuntu 18.04 and Linux Mint 19.0).

 * A conference Pack was ordered  from Canonical but unfortunately it arrived with Ubuntu 16.04 flash drives.  Three members converted the flash drives to Ubuntu 18.04 so that they could be handed out at the Installfest to interested individuals.	
      
 * A spare monitor, keyboard, power cable, and mouse was on hand in case they were needed which they were not.

**LESSONS LEARNED:**

 * Even though we continue to broadened our publicity we were not satisfied with the turnout so we must continue to seek new ways to publicize the event.
