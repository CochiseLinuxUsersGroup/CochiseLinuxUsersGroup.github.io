The Cochise Linux User Group (CLUG) in conjunction with the Ubuntu Arizona Local Community (AZLOCO) set up and ran an information booth at the 12th annual West End Fair in Sierra Vista AZ.  An estimate of 1500 to 2000 people attended the Fair and perhaps three dozen people expressed an interest in CLUG and/or Ubuntu and Free and Open Source Software.  Only 5 left their email addresses to be contacted at a later time.  Information sheets on CLUG and AZLOCO activities and events in the Sierra Vista area were distributed (which also provided local points of contact for additional information) as were Ubuntu pins, stickers, and lanyards.  The booth was manned by a total of 10 individuals at one time or another from 0900-1500.

**After Action Report:**

 * INTRODUCTION:  The Cochise Linux User Group (CLUG) staffed an information booth in conjunction with the Ubuntu Arizona Local Community (AZLOCO) at the 12th annual West End Fair on May 6, 2017 from 10am to 3pm.  There were a total of 10 people manning the booth thought out the day of the event.  We passed out fliers about the CLUG, AZLOCO, and open source software.   Approximately 1500-2000 people attended the fair.  Perhaps three dozen people stopped by to ask questions.  We had a total of 6 interested people who signed up for additional information. 
 * EQUIPMENT USED:  5 chairs, 2 tables, 1 canopy, 1 cooler, 2 banners, 3 set of fliers and Ubuntu SWAG, 4 sand bags, 4 rocks to hold down the fliers, water and soda for people manning the booth, bungee cords, ropes, and tie downs.
 * PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED/LESSONS LEARNED:  The wind was a huge factor and we may need to reevaluate the situation for next year with regard to additional ways to secure the canopy.  The canvas top had to be removed because of the 20-25 knot wind which was gusting to 40 knots. There was confusion when the application was submitted regarding the CLUGâ€™s status as a community organization or a non-profit organization.  This needs to be resolved for next year or we will be paying additional application costs.
 * RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE EVENTS:  Submit the application early.  Since we did we were able to sort out the above problem. Only a AZLoCo team leader or admin can order the Ubuntu conference pack, so request early.  It requires at least 30 days. Being last minute about planning is probably not the best option for this type of event.  While this event is not a complicated one ensuring that the booth is manned all day by competent individuals should be done in plenty of time to find substitutes should that be required.  In addition back up equipment should be planned for in case of failure of some to show or function properly.
