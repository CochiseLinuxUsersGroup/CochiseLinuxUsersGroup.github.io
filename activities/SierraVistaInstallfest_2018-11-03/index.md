The Cochise Linux User Group, CLUG, in conjunction with the Ubuntu Arizona Local Community Team, AZLOCO, conducted an Installation Festival on Saturday, 03 November at the Sierra Vista Public Library meeting room room.  Sixteen people attended the event which resulted in two installs (both Lubuntu 18.04.1).  A one on one training session was conducted on Ubuntu and its flavors demonstrating what each application does and on Linux operating systems and how to choose the correct one for your computer.  Distributed Ubuntu stickers, lanyards, and pins as well as information about Free and Open Source Software and the local Linux groups.  Discussions were held on possible additional publicity for the next installfest and a location change for the 2019 installfests.

**PREPARATIONS:**

* Coordination was done with Susan Abend, Adult Services Librarian, Leisure & Library Services, Sierra Vista Public Library, for use of the meeting room back in April 2018.
      
* Publicizing the event started approximately two months before the event and took the form of flyers that were posted in various locations around town and the Education Center on Fort Huachuca, posting a notice in the Cochise Trading Post, posting a notice on the Sierra Vista Herald/Reviewâ€™s on line web site (http://www.svherald.com/calendar/#/), and sending copies of the flyer to the CLUG mailing list for distribution to their friends and neighbors and at their places of employment and worship.

 * Hardware for the event was on hand from previous Installfests that was donated by various members of the CLUG and AZLOCO.
 
 * Installation media in the form of, DVDs and USB thumb drives, was on hand from previous Installfests and was updated to the new versions (Ubuntu 18.04.1 and Linux Mint 19.0).

 * A conference Pack from Canonical was on hand from the previous installfest.	
      
 * A spare monitor, keyboard, power cable, and mouse was on hand in case they were needed which they were not.

**LESSONS LEARNED:**

 * Even though we continue to broadened our publicity we were not satisfied with the turnout so we must continue to seek new ways to publicize the event.
 
 * Submission of the notice to the Desert Shopper was done too late for inclusion.  It must be done at least 45 days before the event

 * Since the next installfest will likely be at the SVPL conference room which is much smaller, we will have to work on a way to conserve space.
