While most of our activities deal with solving Linux problems, installing Linux operating systems on computers, and publicizing Linux operating systems and Free and Open Source Software, occasionally there are other things that occur.  Sierra Vista had a snow storm on 29 December.  Tux, the Linux mascot, decided to get out in the snow because he rarely has a chance to do so in hot and dry Arizona.
