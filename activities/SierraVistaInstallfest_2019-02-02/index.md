The Cochise Linux User Group, CLUG, in conjunction with the Ubuntu Arizona Local Community Team, AZLOCO, conducted an Installation Festival on Saturday, 02 February at Livia’s Coffee, 2480 E. Wicox Dr., Sierra Vista AZ.  Sixteen people attended the event which resulted in two installs (Lubuntu and peppermint). Two one on one training sessions were conducted on Thunderbird and GRUB. Distributed Ubuntu stickers, lanyards, and pins as well as information about Free and Open Source Software and the local Linux group.

**PREPARATIONS:**

* Coordination was done with Ashley at Livia’s Coffee for use of their meeting room on 26 December 2018.

* Publicizing the event started approximately two months before the event and took the form of flyers that were posted in various locations around town and the Education Center on Fort Huachuca, posting a notice in the Cochise Trading Post and the Desert Shopper, posting a notice on the Sierra Vista Herald/Review’s on line web site (http://www.svherald.com/calendar/#/), and sending copies of the flyer to the CLUG mailing list for distribution to their friends and neighbors and at their places of employment and worship.

* Hardware for the event was on hand from previous Installfests that was donated by various members of the CLUG and AZLOCO.

* Installation media in the form of, DVDs and USB thumb drives, was on hand from previous Installfests and was updated to the new versions (Ubuntu 18.04.1 and Linux Mint 19.0).

* A conference Pack from Canonical was on hand from the previous installfest.

* A spare monitor, keyboard, power cable, and mouse was on hand in case they were needed which they were not.

**LESSONS LEARNED:**

* Since the room at Livia’s Coffee was a great deal smaller than our previous locations we were very cramped.  Coordination is being done to use the front room at the establishment.  If this cannot be approved then we should consider holding the next installfest at the library conference room or another commercial location.

* The use of WiFi dongles on desktop PCs was very successful.  One should be added to the equipment that we have on hand in case it is needed.

* The installfest packet that was created for this event was very successful.  Continue to use it.

* Continue to expand the publication of the event to attract more participants.  Look into the high schools and middle schools to see if we can expand in that area.
