The Cochise Linux User Group has received computers from members and other people.  In some cases we have repaired them with donated parts and installed a Linux operating system on all of them.  In most cases it has been Ubuntu.  As of 09 April 2020 we have donated 30 of those desktop and laptop computers to individuals and groups.  These are a few of the people who have received them.
