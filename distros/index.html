<!-- Distros We'll Install -->
## Supported Linux Distributions At our mini-workshops, CLUG meetings, Ubuntu
Hours, and other workshop events, we **officially support and can assist with
installing and troubleshooting** the following distributions: ### Fully
Supported by Us - **Ubuntu** (all flavors) - **Linux Mint** (all flavors) -
**LMDE** (Linux Mint Debian Edition) We are happy to offer **limited guidance**
for installing other Linux distributions **if you bring your own installation
media**. > **Note:** > Support for any distributions not listed above is **not
guaranteed** and should not be expected. This support list is based on what most
of our members actively use and are best able to troubleshoot.
